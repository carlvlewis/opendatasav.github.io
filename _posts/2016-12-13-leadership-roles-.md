We are currently seeking a diverse group of individuals to help form the leadership and core team of OpenDataSav as a local brigade of [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org).

*The following leadership roles are based off Code for America’s Brigade Leadership suggested guidelines. While we are in no way bound to these roles, it is a solid starting point. We will open discussion on this at the first OpenDataSAV meetup.*


### BRIGADE LEADERS & CORE TEAM MEMBERS
The Brigade Captain is a volunteer who starts and/or leads a local Brigade community. They commit to developing a sustainable civic technology community in collaboration with local government and community partners, championing Brigade activities in their city, and building out a core leadership team.

+ Brigade Captain 2: Position Vacant

Core Team Members are vital. They diversify and distribute responsibilities in order to be more sustainable and more effective as a unit. Core Team Members collaborate with the Captain(s) to lead specific areas of their local Brigade.

Here are some suggested core team roles:
