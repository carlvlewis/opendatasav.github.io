Open Data SAV is a group of civic-minded residents living in or near the greater metropolitan area of Savannah, Ga. We are currently in the process of becoming a local brigade of [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org).

We share the common belief that by working together to increase the availability and accessibility of public datasets, we can shed new light on issues relevant to our community. 

While some local and regional governmental agencies have already begun modest efforts to make Savannah a truly "Open Data" city, the fact is that we still remain behind many other metropolitan areas of similar population in terms of data transparency, availability and accessibility to the average citizen. 

Our goal is to work with local government agencies and officials to build tools to make public data more useful, and to create an 'open data mindset' in our region's governmental departments.

We hold [regular Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Data-Savannah/) for members and anyone interested in joining. Join us, won't you?
